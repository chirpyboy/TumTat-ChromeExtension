# TumTat Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June, 2023*

## Introduction

TumTat ("we", "our", or "extension") is a Chrome extension that helps users summarize, translate, and search for information from web content. This privacy policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your data when using the TumTat extension.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Web Page Content

- **Page Content Data**: The extension reads the content of the web page you are viewing to provide summarization, translation, and question-answering features.
- **Selected Text**: When you select a text segment on a web page and use TumTat, that text will be processed.

### 2. Settings Data

- **Language Preferences**: We store your chosen response language in the extension settings.

## How We Use Information

The collected data is only used to:

1. **Provide Core Services**: Text data is sent to the Gemini API for summarization, translation, or answering questions.
2. **Store User Preferences**: Settings are stored locally to improve your experience.

## Data Sharing

### Third-Party APIs

- **Gemini AI**: We use the Gemini API provided by Google to process text. Data sent to this API is subject to [Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/).

## Data Security

- We **do not store** web page content or selected text on our servers.
- Data is transmitted using secure connections (HTTPS) when sent to the Gemini API.
- User settings are stored locally on your browser through the Chrome Storage API.

## Data Access

TumTat requires the following permissions to operate:
- `activeTab`: To read the content of the current tab
- `contextMenus`: To create right-click menu options
- `storage`: To store user settings
- `declarativeNetRequest`: To modify headers for interacting with the Gemini API

## Children's Data

Our extension is not targeted at and does not intentionally collect information from children under 13 years of age. If we discover that we have collected personal data from children under 13, we will delete that information immediately.

## Privacy Policy Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on our website and through extension updates.
